### About me
I'm currently a data science master's student at Stanford University. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statistics at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.

I enjoy leveraging data-driven insights and SOA machine learning models to solve real-world challenges, spanning from optimizing models for better performance to mitigating bias in LLM.

### My experience
#### eBay, Personalization Science, User Segmentation
During my tenure at eBay in San Jose, CA, I contributed significantly to the Personalization Science Team as a Data Scientist Intern. My key accomplishments included enhancing user segmentation through a sophisticated __community detection model__ leveraging _Siamese Networks_ and _User-to-User graphs_, resulting in more detailed user clusters with stable performance. Additionally, I optimized model training efficiency by fine-tuning hyperparameters and implemented clustering algorithms to achieve higher silhouette scores for user clusters. My contributions extended to developing an automatic naming pipeline for user clusters using LLM, a framework for which a patent application was filed.

#### Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Institute of Disease Modeling
I had the privilege of collaborating with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on a project focused on __disease modeling of rubella vaccine introduction in Nigeria__. Our aim was to assess the potential outcomes of incorporating a rubella-contained vaccine into Nigeria's routine immunization program. We assessed the current surveillance system, proposed new vaccine introduction strategies, and modeled vaccination scenarios across states with varying economic statuses using an _SIR_ model. Our analysis highlighted the nuanced relationship between vaccine effectiveness and economic status. By employing predictive analytics techniques like _linear regression_, we tailored a precise timeline for vaccine introduction, catering to the unique needs of different states. Our findings have significant implications for improving immunization outcomes in Nigeria and beyond.


#### KPMG, Risk Consulting
My experience at KPMG as a Data Analyst intern focused on building risk management platform. I conducted thorough data analysis on sales data from a client e-commerce company, uncovering insights into profit trends during the pandemic and building predictive models (_regression_, _tree_) to forecast store revenue.

### My Research Interest
I'm interested in the broad application of machine learning in real world problems. Some of my interests and projects are listed below:

##### Natural Language Processing
1. Unveiling Vulnerabilities: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Safety Certifying Framework Against Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models
